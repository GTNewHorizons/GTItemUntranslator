This mod displays the original English names of items and blocks from GregTech and its addons directly in their tooltips. 
This solves the communication barrier for players using translated game clients, allowing them to easily identify items when talking to other players or looking up information online. 
You can toggle the tooltip addition on/off with a command /gtip on/off
